       * that is 42.0 units up and 42.0 units right.

       * This function uses a recursive "divide and conquer" algorithm. It first
       * quickly samples a few points to see if any of them have grid code zero.

       * this hyperrectangle by showing that at least one module never has grid
       * code zero for any point in this hyperrectangle. Finally, if neither

       * Given a set of grid cell module parameters, determines the diameter of
       * the k-dimensional cube in which every location has a unique grid cell
       * representation.
       *
       * This function iteratively builds out a larger hypercube out of smaller
       * hyperrectangles, relying on findGridCodeZero to analyze each
       * hyperrectangle. The hypercube expands outward from the origin, forming
       * a larger hypercube that contains positive and negative numbers. After
       * the nearest grid code zero is found, we divide the hypercube in half to
       * get a hypercube in which every location is guaranteed to be unique
       * (rather than just being different from the starting location). The
       * returned diameter is the diameter of this smaller hypercube.
       *
       * Each grid cell module is specified by a pair of matrices. The first one
       * projects a k-dimensional point to a 2D plane, and the second matrix
       * specifies the basis of the grid lattice on this plane, specifying which
       * points on the plane have equivalent grid codes. The distance between
       * two grid codes is equal to the shortest distance between them on the
       * plane. The readout resolution parameter is measured in units of this
       * distance.
       *
       * There's not a strictly "correct" way to configure these matrices and
       * the readout resolution, but a typical way is to use unit vectors as
       * lattice basis vectors, use a plane projection that normalizes distances
       * so that 1 unit is 1 "scale", and then set the readout resolution to
       * some number in the range (0, 1) so that it is measured in units of
       * "scales".
       *
       * @param domainToPlaneByModule
       * A list of 2*k matrices, one per module. The matrix converts from a
       * point in the domain to a point on a plane, normalizing for grid cell
       * scale.
       *
       * @param latticeBasisByModule
       * A list of m 2*2 matrices, one per module. This matrix contains the
       * basis vectors for a lattice, specifying which points on the plane have
       * equivalent location representations in this module.
       *
       * @param readoutResolution
       * The precision of readout of this grid code, measured in distance on the
       * plane. For example, if this is 0.2, then all points on the plane are
       * indistinguishable from those in their surrounding +- 0.1 range.
       *
       * @param ignoredCenterDiameter
       * The diameter of the hypercube at the center which should be ignored,
       * because it contains the *actual* grid code zero. Set this to be
       * sufficiently large to get away from this actual zero.
       *

       * - The diameter of the hypercube that contains no collisions.
       * - A point just outside this hypercube that collides with the origin.
